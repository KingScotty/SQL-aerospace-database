SQL Aerospace Database
A collaborative SQL database project developed alongside fellow classmates, showcasing our collective skills in database design, administration, and system management. This project demonstrates not only our ability to build a fully functional SQL database but also our proficiency in integrating internal documentation using spreadsheets for seamless behind-the-scenes operations.

This repository highlights key aspects of database management, including:

Table Creation and Management: Structured and optimized data tables to meet aerospace industry standards.
System Administration Tasks: Implemented essential administrative functions for efficient database operation.
Internal Documentation via Spreadsheets: Developed accompanying spreadsheets to document internal processes and provide clarity for system operations.
By working on this project, we honed our abilities in SQL programming, teamwork, and technical problem-solving. The accompanying spreadsheet serves as a critical internal reference document, demonstrating how data can be organized and tracked efficiently in real-world scenarios.
